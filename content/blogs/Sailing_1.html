<p><strong>Sailing</strong> has been one of the most valuable experiences of my life. Thanks to this experience, I had the chance to <em>travel the world</em> and <em>grow</em> as an individual. My mindset and attitude have both benefited so much from all the adventures I lived in this field.</p>
<p>I started sailing on the <strong>Optimist</strong> (the boat for beginners) when I was 8 years old. I have to admit I was terrified to step onto a boat and navigate offshore. Fortunately, thanks to my fatherâ€™s drive and my grit to compete against my peers, I started enjoying it and eventually I fell in love with this sport.</p>

<p>After gaining confidence and getting more and more skilled, I stepped on the <strong>Laser</strong>, a boat for more advanced sailors. On this boat, I managed to obtain the first ambitious results. The first good results came from <em>regional</em> races, in fact I managed to win one <em>gold</em> and two <em>silver</em> medals in the regional championship. Here a pic of a prize ceremony in 2017.</p>

<p>Over time, nationwide results started coming too. In 2017 and 2018 I reached the long-awaited target of the <strong>Top 10</strong> in the Italian ranking. In fact, in both 2017 and 2018 I managed to qualify for both the world and the European championship. In <strong>2017</strong>, I took part in the worlds held in <em>Medemblik</em>, Netherlands and the Europeans held in <em>Gdynia</em>, Poland, whereas in <strong>2018</strong> the worlds were held in <em>Kiel</em>, Germany and the Europeans on the <em>Lake Balaton</em>, Hungary. Here a pic of me and my teammates during the opening ceremony in <em>Kiel</em>.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I still try to find the time to have a sailing session and enjoy the <em>nature</em>, tasting the magic flavor of this <strong>passion</strong>.</p>
