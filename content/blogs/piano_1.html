<h2>The benefits of playing an instrument</h2>
<p>Playing an instrument is something everybody should do. Making time to build this additional <em>skill</em> is definitely worth it. In fact, recent research suggests that learning how to play a new instrument increases <em>IQ</em> by 9 points. Anyways, it’s easy to understand that being able to adapt to a <strong>new “work frame”</strong> and being able to read and play music increases <em>flexibility</em> and creates new <em>neural connections</em>.</p>

<div id="the-first-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>The first approach</h2>
<p>My experience with music has been one of a kind. I started playing the piano when I was 13 years old. Although, this is definitely not the moment when I approached a piano for the first time, because I started strumming on the piano when I was 10 years old, trying to reproduce the songs I heard around.</p>
<p>I maintained this attitude throughout the whole experience with the instrument, since I always tried to leave my trace through improvising or composing piano tracks from scratch. Nevertheless, talent is nothing without hard work and practice. Therefore, I decided to start studying at Yamaha music school in Lecce to put into practice this penchant and to finally give vent to my creativity.</p>

<div id="the-academic-experience" class="section level2">
<h2>The academic experience</h2>
<p>Even though the music school I went to was a proper <strong>academy</strong> - meaning I had to follow study schedules and dedicate a fixed amount of time to <strong>practicing</strong> every day - I didn’t feel the weight of this. In that period, I had to manage a <em>busy</em> schedule: studying for school, studying for the music academy and training for sailing races. Nevertheless, I really perceived the moments dedicated to playing the piano as a chance to take a break and truly taste the pleasure of “producing music”.</p>
<p>In addition, the school has always given me the chance to express my creativity and “draw outside the margins”. In fact, when it came the moment of the <strong>final exhibition</strong> - which was the most important event of the academic year - I was free to present tracks I composed myself and, at the same time, play the musical classics. This is a pic of me playing my first composition at the final exhibition.</p>

<p>I am really glad of the <em>environment</em> and the people thanks to whom I had the chance to grow and give direction to this talent. I still make some time to sit down and improvise or <em>rehearse</em> the tracks I composed in the past or the musical classics I studied.</p>
