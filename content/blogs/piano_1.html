<p>Playing an instrument is something everybody should do. Making time to build this additional <em>skill</em> is definitely worth it. In fact, recent research suggests that learning how to play a new instrument increases <em>IQ</em> by 9 points. Anyways, it’s easy to understand that being able to adapt to a <strong>new “work frame”</strong> and being able to read and play music increases <em>flexibility</em> and creates new <em>neural connections</em>.</p>

<h2>The first approach</h2>
<p>My experience with music has been one of a kind. I started playing the piano when I was 13 years old. Although, this is definitely not the moment when I approached a piano for the first time, because I started strumming on the piano when I was 10 years old, trying to reproduce the songs I heard around.</p>
<p>I maintained this attitude throughout the whole experience with the instrument, since I always tried to leave my trace through improvising or composing piano tracks from scratch. Nevertheless, talent is nothing without hard work and practice. Therefore, I decided to start studying at Yamaha music school in Lecce to put into practice this penchant and to finally give vent to my creativity.</p>
