## The benefits of playing an instrument

Playing an instrument is something everybody should do. Making time to build this additional *skill* is definitely worth it. In fact, recent research suggests that learning how to play a new instrument increases *IQ* by 9 points. Anyways, it's easy to understand that being able to adapt to a **new "work frame"** and being able to read and play music increases *flexibility* and creates new *neural connections*.

## The first approach

My experience with music has been one of a kind. I started playing the piano when I was 13 years old. Although, this is definitely not the moment when I approached a piano for the first time, because I started strumming on the piano when I was 10 years old, trying to reproduce the songs I heard around.

I maintained this attitude throughout the whole experience with the instrument, since I always tried to leave my trace through improvising or composing piano tracks from scratch. Nevertheless, talent is nothing without hard work and practice. Therefore, I decided to start studying at Yamaha music school in Lecce to put into practice this penchant and to finally give vent to my creativity.

## The academic experience

Even though the music school I went to was a proper **academy** - meaning I had to follow study schedules and dedicate a fixed amount of time to **practicing** every day - I didn't feel the weight of this. In that period, I had to manage a *busy* schedule: studying for school, studying for the music academy and training for sailing races. Nevertheless, I really perceived the moments dedicated to playing the piano as a chance to take a break and truly taste the pleasure of "producing music".

In addition, the school has always given me the chance to express my creativity and "draw outside the margins". In fact, when it came the moment of the **final exhibition** - which was the most important event of the academic year - I was free to present tracks I composed myself and, at the same time, play the musical classics. This is a pic of me playing my first composition at the final exhibition.

```

I am really glad of the *environment* and the people thanks to whom I had the chance to grow and give direction to this talent. I still make some time to sit down and improvise or *rehearse* the tracks I composed in the past or the musical classics I studied.
