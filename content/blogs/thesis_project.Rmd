My **final undergraduate thesis** is definitely one of my most significant projects. Its analytical content fits perfectly with my *goals* and *professional interests*. Also, with this project I had the chance to contribute to the research in the field of decision-making science.

The goal of the thesis is to prove that it is possible to apply the **control chart**, one of the most significant statistical tools, to the **analysis of variances**, which is one of the most important steps of the broader *budget analysis*.

The *first question* I attempted to answer is whether it is **statistically possible** to use the model in its traditional setting to analyse the budget variances. IN order to answer this question, I used *data visualization* tools and *statistical tests* to actually prove that the assumptions of the control chart were found to be verified. Of course, I used **empirical evidences** to do so thanks to a company that provided me with the necessary data.

Secondly, I tried to prove that it was actually **beneficial** and **convenient** for the organization to use a tool such this to check the stability of both the budgeting process and the most significant budget values. In order to do so, I listed the **costs** to build and use such a model and the **benefits** that could arise from the sound use of it.

Finally, I gathered a handful of *tips* and *directions* for the reader, since the data used to prove the *feasibility* of the application of the model were gathered by a single company. Hence, given that **different scenarios** and company's characteristics may definitely affect the application and use of the tool, the analyst has to be *warn* about the implications of applying the model to different cases.

## Data manipulation

### Exploring Data

First, it is important to have sense of the data we are dealing with, so let's produce a glimpse of the data set.

```{r, glimpse_database, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

glimpse(sata_database)
skim(select(sata_database,2:11))
```

In the database, we have both the *budget* and the *final account* for the income statement of all the years between 2017 and 2021 inclusive. Also, all the data are expressed in thousands of euros.

### Data Investigation: proving the assumptions verified

The first step was to investigate about the shape of the **distribution** of the variances over the 5 years. Hence, we needed to create another variable, which is the variance expressed as a *percentage* of the budget value.

```{r, plot_variance_distribution, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Tweaking column names
colnames(sata_database) <- c("Income_statement_voices","Final_2017","Budget_2017","Final_2018","Budget_2018","Final_2019","Budget_2019","Final_2020","Budget_2020","Final_2021","Budget_2021")

# Creating dataset to use
data_to_use <- sata_database %>%
  mutate(Variance_2017 = (Final_2017-Budget_2017)/Budget_2017,Variance_2018 = (Final_2018-Budget_2018)/Budget_2018,Variance_2019 = (Final_2019-Budget_2019)/Budget_2019,Variance_2020 = (Final_2020-Budget_2020)/Budget_2020,Variance_2021 = (Final_2021-Budget_2021)/Budget_2021) %>% 
  select(1,12:16) %>%
# Getting rid of useless values
  filter(Variance_2017!=0&!is.infinite(Variance_2017))

#Plotting the distribution of all the variances
data_to_plot <- data_to_use %>%
  pivot_longer(2:6,names_to="Variance_year",values_to="Variance_percentage")

ggplot(data_to_plot, aes(x=Variance_percentage)) + geom_density()


```

In the graph above, we can easily notice how the distribution of the variances is approximately a **normal distribution**, around the value we assumed is the mean of the "process", that is 0. In fact, a 0 corresponds to the absence of variance, namely the final voice is equal to the voice predicted in the budget.

After this step, I decided to integrate the research of the distribution with another plot - the qq-plot- so that I could more strongly support my conclusion that the distribution of this variable is approximately normal, regardless of the size of the sample. This plot would give me a more precise picture of the actual differences between the distribution of the variances and a perfectly normal distribution.

```{r, qqplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data_to_plot, aes(sample=Variance_percentage)) + stat_qq()

```

Glancing at the qq-plot produced, it is possible to notice how the **upper outliers** are the only elements that prevent the distribution to be a normal distribution: the presence of those values tweaks the **inclination** of the trend line and makes the line appear as not on the *x=y* line, the line corresponding to a perfect normal distribution. This because one of the assumptions of the control chart is the absence of outliers.

Therefore, I decided to add a **tweak** to the traditional process of managing data when building a control chart: it is possible for the analyst to *take off* the sample those values that can be classified as outliers if and only if the "weight" of the income statement voice is *negligible*.

## Conclusions & model setup

After proving the use of the model in this field possible, we decided to finally build the **control chart** of the sample we analysed to verify the assumptions of the model.

```{r, control_chart_pic, out.width="60%", fig.align='center',message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/chart_thesis.png",error=FALSE)
```

After the final result, I was proud to announce the *feasibility* to apply the control chart to the analysis of variances. Thanks to this project, I had the chance to perform many *hands-on tasks* that made me feel my passion for data even more, besides having the chance of producing innovative research in the data analytics field.
