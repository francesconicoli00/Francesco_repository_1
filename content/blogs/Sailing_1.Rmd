**Sailing** has been one of the most valuable experiences of my life. Thanks to this experience, I had the chance to *travel the world* and *grow* as an individual. My mindset and attitude have both benefited so much from all the adventures I lived in this field.

I started sailing on the **Optimist** (the boat for beginners) when I was 8 years old. I have to admit I was terrified to step onto a boat and navigate offshore. Fortunately, thanks to my father's drive and my grit to compete against my peers, I started enjoying it and eventually I fell in love with this sport.

After gaining confidence and getting more and more skilled, I stepped on the **Laser**, a boat for more advanced sailors. On this boat, I managed to obtain the first ambitious results. The first good results came from *regional* races, in fact I managed to win one *gold* and two *silver* medals in the regional championship. Here a pic of a prize ceremony in 2017.

```

Over time, nationwide results started coming too. In 2017 and 2018 I reached the long-awaited target of the **Top 10** in the Italian ranking. In fact, in both 2017 and 2018 I managed to qualify for both the world and the European championship. In **2017**, I took part in the worlds held in *Medemblik*, Netherlands and the Europeans held in *Gdynia*, Poland, whereas in **2018** the worlds were held in *Kiel*, Germany and the Europeans on the *Lake Balaton*, Hungary. Here a pic of me and my teammates during the opening ceremony in *Kiel*.

Nowadays, I still try to find the time to have a sailing session and enjoy the *nature*, tasting the magic flavor of this **passion**.
