As you know by the initial presentation, I have two huge **interests** with regards to the professional scope: entrepreneurship and data analytics. Thanks to my undergraduate journey at *Bocconi* university, I had the chance to explore both these interests more in depth and discover those are actually **passions** of mine. I am genuinely fascinated by the science of translating the language of numbers and by the dream of creating something innovative in this field.

For these reasons, I decided to look for business experiences that would allow me to put this penchant into practice. This is why, as a *first approach* to the work environment, I decided take on roles that were as close as possible to the **data analyst**.

## First internship experience

I had my first internship experience in *Lecce*, my hometown. The company I have been working for is **Valentino Caff√®**, a coffee factory. During the three months I worked for the company, I had the chance to do exactly what I wanted to: I covered an **analyst** role and made a positive impact through the exploration and thorough examination of the company's financial statement.

My core task was to deal with the *allocation of costs* to inventories in stock. I have been given a database in order to fetch the necessary elements for the valuation of the warehouse. This allowed me to put into practice my *IT skills* and figure out efficient and effective ways to get the job done in the least time possible.

```

Eventually, besides successfully completing the task I have been assigned, I also managed to analyse some *auditing errors* and pointing them out to the CFO, the person I was supervised by. This paved the way for the assignment of a new task, which was to work on the **betterment of the database**. In order to get this further task completed, I decided to start by revising all the formulas and the structure of the database in order to have a clear idea of how the data manipulation worked.

After completing this first step, I realized there were some shortcomings, especially in the **formulas** for the allocation of costs and in the way data were **displayed**. Therefore, I modified some *Excel* formulas to make it more efficient and to reduce the chances of error. Finally, I changed the **structure** of some specific tables for the database to look more intuitive and easy to manipulate.

## Internship in Milan

In order to gain additional work experience as a data analyst and in order to be assigned more diverse and challenging tasks, I started an internship in a company in Milan: **Gabesco Srl**, a firm in the field of trading and commercialization of consumer goods. Here, my core task was to assist the controller of the company in the process of migrating all the *customer relationship data* to a new platform provided by SAP. The whole task required different sub tasks and skills. First of all, I had to get acquainted with the **SAP platform** and understand the mechanism. In addition, I had to get familiar with making the excel database and the SAP platform communicate with each other and make sure that the *data transfer* was smooth and error free.

In addition to the core role I had, my supervisor (the controller) also asked me to solve a problem related to the **manipulation** of the database: the goal was to make Excel return specific columns ans sections of the database depending on the user who was using it. I spent the last couple weeks of my internships to find the solution to the problem and I realized I had to use *VBA* to leverage the proper automation tools to work this out.

Hence, given that my knowledge of VBA was very basic, I started looking for the *commands* I needed to solve the problem and, eventually, I managed to almost fully achieve the goal, meaning that it was possible to modify the database based on the user but some *double-check* practices were still needed in order to make sure everything worked smoothly and no data were lost.

## Coding experience

It's not possible to conclude this glimpse of my professional skills and experiences without mentioning my **coding experience**. During my undergrad, I had the chance to take a course of computer science basics - which included Excel formulas and functions and a Python foundations course - and a course on R and Radiant. Thanks to this experience, I realized I was really keen on coding and I started taking lessons and coding courses by myself. I tried to **diversify** my coding skills as much as possible. In fact I took an intermediate course of *Java*, one of the most powerful and complete programming languages.

knitr::include_graphics("/img/professional_coding.jpg",error=FALSE)
```

In addition, I decided to study programming languages closer to my *inclination and professional direction*: SQL and VBA. Hence, I purchased the courses and started coding by myself, always trying to deepen my understanding of the coding logic. For this reason, I ended up pursuing a *Masters in Analytics and Management* to both cultivate my passion about numbers and analytics and get closer to my professional goals.
