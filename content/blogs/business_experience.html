<p>As you know by the initial presentation, I have two huge <strong>interests</strong> with regards to the professional scope: entrepreneurship and data analytics. Thanks to my undergraduate journey at <em>Bocconi</em> university, I had the chance to explore both these interests more in depth and discover those are actually <strong>passions</strong> of mine. I am genuinely fascinated by the science of translating the language of numbers and by the dream of creating something innovative in this field.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I decided to look for business experiences that would allow me to put this penchant into practice. This is why, as a <em>first approach</em> to the work environment, I decided take on roles that were as close as possible to the <strong>data analyst</strong>.</p>

<h2>First internship experience</h2>
<p>I had my first internship experience in <em>Lecce</em>, my hometown. The company I have been working for is <strong>Valentino Caffè</strong>, a coffee factory. During the three months I worked for the company, I had the chance to do exactly what I wanted to: I covered an <strong>analyst</strong> role and made a positive impact through the exploration and thorough examination of the company’s financial statement.</p>
<p>My core task was to deal with the <em>allocation of costs</em> to inventories in stock. I have been given a database in order to fetch the necessary elements for the valuation of the warehouse. This allowed me to put into practice my <em>IT skills</em> and figure out efficient and effective ways to get the job done in the least time possible.</p>

<p>Eventually, besides successfully completing the task I have been assigned, I also managed to analyse some <em>auditing errors</em> and pointing them out to the CFO, the person I was supervised by. This paved the way for the assignment of a new task, which was to work on the <strong>betterment of the database</strong>. In order to get this further task completed, I decided to start by revising all the formulas and the structure of the database in order to have a clear idea of how the data manipulation worked.</p>
<p>After completing this first step, I realized there were some shortcomings, especially in the <strong>formulas</strong> for the allocation of costs and in the way data were <strong>displayed</strong>. Therefore, I modified some <em>Excel</em> formulas to make it more efficient and to reduce the chances of error. Finally, I changed the <strong>structure</strong> of some specific tables for the database to look more intuitive and easy to manipulate.</p>

<h2>Internship in Milan</h2>
<p>In order to gain additional work experience as a data analyst and in order to be assigned more diverse and challenging tasks, I started an internship in a company in Milan: <strong>Gabesco Srl</strong>, a firm in the field of trading and commercialization of consumer goods. Here, my core task was to assist the controller of the company in the process of migrating all the <em>customer relationship data</em> to a new platform provided by SAP. The whole task required different sub tasks and skills. First of all, I had to get acquainted with the <strong>SAP platform</strong> and understand the mechanism. In addition, I had to get familiar with making the excel database and the SAP platform communicate with each other and make sure that the <em>data transfer</em> was smooth and error free.</p>
<p>In addition to the core role I had, my supervisor (the controller) also asked me to solve a problem related to the <strong>manipulation</strong> of the database: the goal was to make Excel return specific columns ans sections of the database depending on the user who was using it. I spent the last couple weeks of my internships to find the solution to the problem and I realized I had to use <em>VBA</em> to leverage the proper automation tools to work this out.</p>
<p>Hence, given that my knowledge of VBA was very basic, I started looking for the <em>commands</em> I needed to solve the problem and, eventually, I managed to almost fully achieve the goal, meaning that it was possible to modify the database based on the user but some <em>double-check</em> practices were still needed in order to make sure everything worked smoothly and no data were lost.</p>

<div id="coding-experience" class="section level2">
<h2>Coding experience</h2>
<p>It’s not possible to conclude this glimpse of my professional skills and experiences without mentioning my <strong>coding experience</strong>. During my undergrad, I had the chance to take a course of computer science basics - which included Excel formulas and functions and a Python foundations course - and a course on R and Radiant. Thanks to this experience, I realized I was really keen on coding and I started taking lessons and coding courses by myself. I tried to <strong>diversify</strong> my coding skills as much as possible. In fact I took an intermediate course of <em>Java</em>, one of the most powerful and complete programming languages.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../../../../../img/professional_coding.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In addition, I decided to study programming languages closer to my <em>inclination and professional direction</em>: SQL and VBA. Hence, I purchased the courses and started coding by myself, always trying to deepen my understanding of the coding logic. For this reason, I ended up pursuing a <em>Masters in Analytics and Management</em> to both cultivate my passion about numbers and analytics and get closer to my professional goals.</p>
